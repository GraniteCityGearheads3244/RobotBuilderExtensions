# RobotBuilderExtensions

These extensions are an improvment over the installed files as well as a few new ones. 

CPP exporters are not well defined and may or may not work. This could be part of this issue  https://github.com/wpilibsuite/RobotBuilder/issues/145 

The CAN Speed Controler Group is experimental where I'm tring to create a Speed Controler group that honors the follow mode most CAN motor controlers have.

## Installation
Just Download the repository, and unzip the contents into your wpilib installation folder usually found here on windows C:\Users\Public\wpilib"year"\Robotbuilder\extensions
